[00:01.83] Baby, how's your life?
[00:03.39] Are you living free?
[00:04.26] Let's forget everything and have some fun
[00:06.26] Chu-chu-chu!
[00:12.26] 
[00:07.61] Here we roll dice, here we cast dice
[00:09.48] Here we just play dice! (Yeah)
[00:11.07] Baby, baby, there's no need to think twice
[00:12.89] Dari-wari, woah
[00:14.21] Make it your night, make it your fight
[00:15.60] Make it your spotlight (yeah)
[00:17.62] Get out from the hamster wheel
[00:19.19] And rule your life
[00:21.36] Five, four, three, two, one, play dice!
[00:40.86] 
[00:23.62] (Hey, hey, Bae, Bae)
[00:26.93] (Hey, hey, Bae, Bae)
[00:30.15] (Hey, hey, Bae, Bae)
[00:33.10] Baby
[00:35.10] 
[00:34.01] So the space went "bang" and we were all born
[00:36.04] The order we knew, ripped and torn
[00:37.70] But we have no time to complain
[00:39.54] 'Cause life is short, can't do it over again (nah-uh)
[00:41.82] If we can laugh, it doesn't matter where or when
[00:45.67] Be 自チュウ奔放
[00:50.17] 
[00:47.91] Physics don't play the dice?
[00:49.33] So let trouble stir and rise
[00:51.02] Be limits, bounds, rules, or chains
[00:52.53] 意味なんてない
[00:54.41] So we don't give a Chu
[00:56.24] やなことは そっと Mute
[00:58.08] So find something new
[00:59.70] 身体中一瞬で夢中
[01:03.70] 
[01:01.18] No cage can trap this rat (Bae!)
[01:02.68] No cage can trap this rat (Bae!)
[01:04.35] No cage can trap this rat (Bae!)
[01:20.35] 
[01:07.24] Here we roll dice, here we cast dice
[01:08.79] Here we just play dice! (Yeah)
[01:10.35] Yell and scream, come on now
[01:11.71] Don't be too nice, dari-wari, woah
[01:13.80] Follow your heart, pump your fist up
[01:15.35] Come and join the club (yeah)
[01:17.32] Go and scream for you, the one who's flying free
[01:20.43] カオスのダイスのままでいい
